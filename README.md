## Usage

You can also run it with one line like this:

```sh
python run.py <mode> [renew-time-minutes] <balance-usdt-to-use> <pair> <exchanges list separated by commas (no space!)>
```


* ```<mode>``` = the mode you wanna use between ```fake-money``` and ```real```. See [full version](#full-version) for real mode. 
  
  * ```fake-money``` will run the bot with the balance-usdt-to-use you put, with a virtual balance, just to test.
  * ```real``` will run the bot with real money, and your strategy.
  
* ```[renew-time-minutes]``` = ONLY IF YOU ENABLED RENEWAL SETTING IN THE CONFIG. If you enabled it, you have to put the number of minutes a session should last. After each session, the bot sells all the assets back to rebalance. Note: you can trigger a manual rebalance while in a session by pressing the Enter key.

* ```<balance-usdt-to-use>``` = how to be clearer? 

* ```<pair>``` = The pair you want to arbitrage on.

* ```<exchanges list>``` = the exchanges you want the bot to scan the orderbooks on, among all the [CCXT-compatible exchanges](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt). From a 2 exchanges minimum, up to an unlimited number. Don't forget to configure the exchanges in [exchange_config.py](exchange_config.py).

Examples:

with renewal disabled (default):
```sh
python run.py fake-money 500 EOS/USDT binance,okx,kucoin    # run the bot with 500 USDT and rebalance every 15 minutes, with binance okx and kucoin
```
with renewal enabled:
```sh
python run.py real 15 1000 SOL/USDT binance,poloniex,kucoin   # run the bot with 1000 USDT on binance phemex and bybit on SOL/USDT, and rebalance every 15 minutes.
```
